## Thar-God Settlements

The two abandoned settlements listed below contain a total of 9 audio log entries from the __Thar-God__ cultists. The __Sanctum__ has the first 4 entries, and the __Prophet__ has the other 5 (at least that's how it worked for me). Don't bother trying to listen as you collect them because it's basically impossible to collect them in order.

When I explored the settlements, I found absolutely nothing in the __Sanctum__ in the way of loot, materials, or data. However, the __Prophet__ had maybe 5 manufactured materials laying around to collect in your SRV. There's absolutely nothing to find on foot in either location.

## Quick Background:

Both the __Sanctum__ and the __Prophet__ are abandoned settlements that previously belonged to the __Thar-God__ cult. Presumably, both settlements were forcefully cleared out by Federation forces when the Federation declared their "religion" to be a terrorist organization (or something to that effect) and arrested any and all cultist members they could find.

The Alliance then offered the cultists amnesty if they agreed to a reasonable amount of government oversight and the Federation arranged to have them moved to Alliance territory aboard a Megaship named the Dedicant. Then the Dedicant abruptly jumped to hyperspace ahead of schedule and seem to have vanished without a trace.

For the full story, you can find the not-so-recent news regarding the cult and their general disappearance aboard the Dedicant in GalNet News (in-game), and play them like audio books in your Playlist. As for the audio logs you would collect, they seem to hint at what may have happened, though in an extremely vague manner.

## The Real Question:
### Is it worth the time?

For most people? Probably not.

For me, considering I only found these settlements in an effort to farm resources, it was a huge waste of my time. I'm only documenting this because online resources are either lacking, or missing entirely.
